# Quantum FTP

## Qiskit Fall Fest 2021

Quantum File Transfer Protocol or Quantum FTP is used to transfer entire file from some set of Qubits to Other set of Qubits, which are seperated at any distance with high security.

This protocol is totally based on Quantum Teleportation Algorithm.

By using Quantum FTP we can send or teleport unlimited data stored in a file. 

we can use 'N' number of Qubits dynamically and the circuit will change accordingly
